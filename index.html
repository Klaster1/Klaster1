			<h2>GridGain (2017 till now) - Frontend developer</h2>
			<h3>
				<a href="https://portal.gridgain.com" target="_blank"
					>GridGain Nebula</a
				>
			</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.gridgain.com">GridGain</a> SaaS, allows to
				provision, manage and monitor GridGain and Apache Ignite clusters.
			</p>
			<h4>Highlights</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Architected the Angular application from scratch, maintained and grew
					it ever since. New developers did not have much trouble joining the
					project.
				</li>
				<li>
					Designed and implemented a framework for highly customizeable
					monitoring dashboards a-la Grafana. The framework decouples dashboard
					management and individual widgets, making it easy to add new widgets
					using well-defined interfaces. I authored several such widgets, which
					involved charting (Chart.js), grids (AgGrid) and real-time data
					sources.
				</li>
				<li>
					Implemented a networking layer for the frontend app to communicate
					with a GridGain cluster over a custom RPC protocol based on WebSockets
					and <a href="https://stomp.github.io">STOMP</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Proposed a generic way to monitor and handle long running cluster
					operations, which was implemented later by the backend team. I try to
					get insight into every part of the project I'm working on, even if my
					expterise lies elsewhere.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ensured test coverage stayed at high level, both for unit (Jasmine)
					and E2E (TestCafe) tests. Authored lots of tests myself.
				</li>
				<li>
					Implemented a Node.js-based tool to mock complex backend
					infrastructure, the tool was used for rapid UI development and in E2E
					tests via a TestCafe adapter. This required for me to learn low-level
					WebSocket and STOMP details. The tool exposes an easy to use public
					API so other developers don't have to understand all the low-level
					details.
				</li>
				<li>
					Delivered features on time as a part of cross-functional team.
					Participated in design of most of the project aspects. Sometimes, I
					had to manage the frontend team, which included transforming vague
					feature descriptions from higher ups into concrete Jira tasks and
					epics, and planning the execution of those.
				</li>
				<li>
					Did lots of code reviews. During reviews, I prefer to inspect if the
					implementation matches the requirements, how well the code is
					designed, the ease of supporting it later, how comprehensive the code
					coverage is; I don't care about minutae like formatting, this should
					be handled by automatic code formatting, which I also introduced to
					the project (Prettier). My collegues highly regard code reviews I do.
				</li>
				<li>
					Due to complex nature of data, most of features used a different mix
					of REST/STOMP/RPC, this had to be factored into all steps the of
					development process - what are UI limitations, how to present the data
					better, what are available tools, how to structure backend endpoints -
					I took a very active role in all of these activities.
				</li>
				<li>
					As a part of the team, participated in process adjustments, quite a
					few of my suggestions solved various pain points.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Apache Ignite Control Center</h3>
			<p>
				A previous generation of Apache Ignite and GridGain monitoring and
				management solution, superseded by GridGain nebula.
			</p>
			<h4>Highlights:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					When I joined the project (written in Angular.js), it had a structure
					that did not scale and was hard to maintain. To address this, I've
					re-architected it to use modern approaches like components, introduced
					E2E testing, RxJS for real time data and helped team mates to learn
					these new tools and approaches.
				</li>
				<li>
					The project was open-sourced under the Apache Software Foundation. I
					am an ASF contributor.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Saritasa (2013-2017) - Frontend developer</h2>
			<p>
				A small consulting shop with offices in USA, Russsia and Vietnam. I
				learned a lot here.
			</p>
			<h4>Highlights</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					My last project at Saritasa was a rewrite of a trading app UI from
					Java (desktop) to web (Angular.js) and mobile (Angular.js, Ionic,
					Apache Cordova). I've architected the Angular.js app, learning along
					the way how to work with real time data, design very customizeable
					UIs, share the same codebase in web and mobile apps, optimize the
					performance (Chrome Web Inspector CPU and memory profilers were the
					go-to tools). These lessons turned out super-usefulful for later work
					in GridGain.
				</li>
				<li>
					Overall, lots of small to medium size projects in Angular.js, web and
					mobile (Apache Cordova).
